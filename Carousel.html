  <h1>The Objective</h1>
  <p>Turn the carousel into two rows that move simultaneously with the navigation buttons. Images should not repeat and images added to the UGC gallery that are drawn by the API should add to the carousel. ie. The content should remain dynamic and not be made into static content. Full responsive compatibility should be maintained.</p>
  <p>Here is a video showing how the slider should operate when clicking the nav buttons and what happens when you reach either end. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIfGHefVQ0Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIfGHefVQ0Y</a></p>
  <p>This can be achieved a number of ways. If you are not successful explain your logic as to how you got to where you did.</p>
  <p>Documentation on the carousel can be found on the <a href="https://community.offerpop.com/docs/DOC-1323" target="_blank">Offerpop Community Website.</a> Use the campaign id 9844 and the access token 'R3ggcIaeRA665XN8J4Qlbeg5LTvUAN' for this example.</p>
